# Hi there, I'm Dani! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **freelance project manager**, **ESL tutor**, and an **aspiring coder** currently based in Argentina. I'm passionate about **coding**, **web development**, and building tools to help people learn and grow. Here, you'll find a mix of my latest projects, learning progress, and resources I create to help others.

## üå± About Me

- **Stay-at-Home Mom** | I am a stay-at-home mom of 1 rowdy toddler.
- **Freelancer** | I work as a project/account manager and ESL tutor, aiming to transition into full-time coding.
- **Outdoor Enthusiast** | Love spending time in nature, gardening (getting sucked down the hydroponics rabbit-hole), and exploring new places.
- **Aspiring Developer** | Currently exploring **Python** and **web development** with a focus on accessibility and creating practial applications.
- **Future Goals** | My goal is to work remotely as a developer, continue learning, and eventually move back to the US.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects and Highlights

Here are a few things I'm working on:

- **[OnlineTutoringResources.com](https://www.onlinetutoringresources.com)**: My first client as a freelance web developer! We're working on creating a small eCommerce site for their homemade (and pretty amazing) lesson plans for ESL tutors.
- **[Budget Tracker Program](https://github.com/danitellini/Budget-Tracker-Program)**: I started this for a Codecademy course project, and would like to further develop this.
- **[Book Recommendation Program](https://github.com/danitellini/Book-Recommendation-Program)**: This is a new project for a Codecademy course as well that I will be completing as I move through this new unit. ***UPDATE**: This has been put on hold, as I've temporarily suspended this learning path as I continue through another.*
- **[My Portfolio Website](https://danitellini.dev)**: This is a work-in-progress. The domain has been bought, but not hosted. *UPDATED 31 DECEMBER 2024*
- **Future Founder's Checklist**: This is something I want to put together for my Codecademy community. It is just a little thought bubble at the moment.

## üìöCurrently Learning

I'm focusing on expanding my skills with:

- **HTML/CSS/JS** | I started with Python, but over the course of some of my learning, I have gravitated more towards web development. All of my projects are available in a [study group repository](https://github.com/danitellini/CodingBuddies) that I've put together.
- **Accessbility** | Exploring inclusive web design principles to create better experiences for all users.

I'm dabbling in:

- **Python** | Building small projects and practicing with Codecademy's courses and projects.
- **Java** | I previously helped a Java programmer with interview prep, and developed an interest that I just have to itch!
