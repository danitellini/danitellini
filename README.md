# Hi there, I'm Dani! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **freelance project manager**, **ESL tutor**, and an **aspiring coder** currently based in Argentina. I'm passionate about **coding**, **web development**, and building tools to help people learn and grow. Here, you'll find a mix of my latest projects, learning progress, and resources I create to help others.

## üå± About Me

- **Stay-at-Home Mom** | I am a stay-at-home mom of 1 rowdy toddler.
- **Freelancer** | I work as a project manager and ESL tutor, aiming to transition into full-time coding.
- **Outdoor Enthusiast** | Love spending time in nature, gardening (getting sucked down the hydroponics rabbit-hole), and exploring new places.
- **Aspiring Developer** | Currently exploring **Python** and **web development** with a focus on building practical applications and creating interactive coding resources.
- **Future Goals** | My goal is to work remotely as a developer, continue learning, and eventually move back to the US.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects and Highlights

Here are a few things I'm working on:

- **[Budget Tracker Program](https://github.com/danitellini/Budget-Tracker-Program)**: I started this for a Codecademy course project, and would like to further develop this.
- **[Book Recommendation Program](https://github.com/danitellini/Book-Recommendation-Program)**: This is a new project for a Codecademy course as well that I will be completing as I move through this new unit.
- **[My Portfolio Website](https://danitellini.github.io)**: This is a (currently) 2-line page, but will be developed into my portfolio website while I go through my Full-Stack Engineer course path.
- **Future Founder's Checklist**: This is something I want to put together for my Codecademy community. It is just a little thought bubble at the moment.

## üìöCurrently Learning

I'm focusing on expanding my skills with:

- **HTML/CSS/JS** | I started with Python, but over the course of some of my learning, I have gravitated more towards web development. All of my HTML projects are hosted on my Portfolio Website, but I haven't linked them to the Home page as of yet.
- **Python** | Building small projects and practicing with Codecademy's courses and projects.
